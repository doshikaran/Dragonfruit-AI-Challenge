def has_cancer_microscope_optimized(blob):
    """
    Quickly determine if a specified area (blob) in a binary image is likely to be cancerous
    based on the area occupied by the blob.

    This function calculates the total area of the blob and compares it to the total area
    of the image or the analyzed section. If the blob's area exceeds 25% of the total area,
    it is considered potentially cancerous.

    Parameters:
    - blob (numpy.ndarray): A binary 2D numpy array representing a section of an image,
                            where 1's indicate the presence of the blob (possibly cancerous
                            tissue) and 0's represent the background.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the area of the blob is greater than 25% of the total area, suggesting
            a potential cancerous condition. Otherwise, False.

    Note:
    - This optimized version assumes the input is a numpy array and utilizes numpy's
      efficient array operations for fast computation.

def has_cancer_dye_optimized(dye_distribution, blob):
    """
    Efficiently determine if a specified area (blob) in a binary image is likely to be
    cancerous based on the concentration of a specific dye within that area.

    This function assesses cancer presence by analyzing the concentration of a dye that
    binds to certain tissues or cells. It compares the dye concentration inside the blob
    to a threshold. If the concentration exceeds 10% of the blob's area, the area is
    considered potentially cancerous.

    Parameters:
    - dye_distribution (numpy.ndarray): A binary 2D numpy array representing the
                                        distribution of a specific dye across the image,
                                        where 1's indicate the presence of the dye.
    - blob (numpy.ndarray): A binary 2D numpy array representing a section of an image,
                            indicating the presence of tissue/blob, similar to the input
                            in `has_cancer_microscope_optimized`.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the concentration of the dye within the blob is greater than 10% of
            the blob's area, suggesting a potential cancerous condition. Otherwise, False.

    Note:
    - This optimized version leverages numpy's array operations for efficient computation
      of the dye concentration and comparison against the threshold.
