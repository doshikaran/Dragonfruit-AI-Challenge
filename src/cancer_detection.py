def has_cancer_microscope(blob):
    """
    Determine if a specified area (blob) in a binary image is likely to be cancerous
    based on the area occupied by the blob.

    The decision is made by comparing the area of the blob to a predefined threshold
    percentage of the total area of the image or the analyzed section of the image.

    Parameters:
    - blob (numpy.ndarray): A binary 2D numpy array representing a section of an image,
                            where 1's indicate the presence of tissue/blob and 0's represent
                            the background.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the area of the blob is greater than 25% of the total area, indicating
            a potential cancerous condition. Otherwise, False.

def has_cancer_dye(dye_distribution, blob):
    """
    Determine if a specified area (blob) in a binary image is likely to be cancerous
    based on the concentration of a specific dye within that area.

    This function assesses the presence of cancer by analyzing the concentration of
    a dye that binds to certain tissues or cells, which can be indicative of cancer.
    A threshold for the dye concentration within the blob is used to determine
    the likelihood of cancer.

    Parameters:
    - dye_distribution (numpy.ndarray): A binary 2D numpy array representing the
                                        distribution of a specific dye across the image,
                                        where 1's indicate the presence of the dye.
    - blob (numpy.ndarray): A binary 2D numpy array representing a section of an image,
                            similar to the one described in has_cancer_microscope, indicating
                            the presence of tissue/blob.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the concentration of the dye within the blob is greater than 10% of the
            blob's area, suggesting a potential cancerous condition. Otherwise, False.
